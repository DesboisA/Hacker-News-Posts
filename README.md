# Exploring Hacker News Posts

## Description

This is one of my first data science project.

In this project, the [data set of submissions](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts) to popular technology [site Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) was used to compared two type of posts: 

- `Ask HN`: Users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question

- `Show HN`: Users submit `Show HN` posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting

These two types of posts will be compared to determine the following:

- Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` receive more comments on average?

- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

## Installation

To use this project, first clone the repo on your device using the command below:

```
git init
```
```
git clone https://github.com/DesboisA/Hacker-News-Posts.git
```

## How to contribute to the project

You are welcome to work on this project. Here are some next steps for you to consider:

- Determine if show or ask posts receive more points on average.
- Determine if posts created at a certain time are more likely to receive more points.
- Compare your results to the average number of comments and points other posts receive.

Any comment/ suggestion are welcome !
